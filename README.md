# react-native-testing

This is my first project created with React Native.
There is a lot of things need to be implemented and added to make it functional.
Most of the files here only produce the Views.

Do check out the screenshots of the views for the preview of the apps from screenshots folder. The screenshots are based from iphone X view.

This project is based on squarefoot.com.hk mobile apps.
